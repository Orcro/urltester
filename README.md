# urltester

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/Orcro/urltester)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/Orcro/urltester)

A Java productivity tool written in Clojure which tests the existence of web-servers that are provided by URLs in a text-based file. These text files could be `.txt`, `.md`, or even source code file like `.clj` or `.py`. Boolean results are returned to standard out, and when viewed in a terminal looks something like this:

```
URL: https://www.duckduckgo.com is valid.
URL: https://facebook.com is valid.
URL: https://mynonexistantdomain.com is invalid.
```

## Quick Use

> Full installation instructions are available in `./docs/userInstructions.md`

Download the latest version from the `./releases/` directory, and run like you would any java program:

```bash
$ java -jar urltester-0.5.1.jar my_file_to_check.md
```

Progam output can be used in unix shell pipelines (but this is untested). For example, to open the results in the `Vi` editor:

```bash
$ java -jar urltester-0.5.1.jar my_file_to_check.md | vi -
```
